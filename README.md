# profile_project_one

A new Flutter project. This is my first Flutter project that I wrote in 2022. This is a simple one-page project in which dependency injection and state management are not used, and I have only used Flutter's main widgets in it. One of the cool features of this project is the use of multiple languages in Flutter, which I implemented in Farsi and English, along with the beautiful Farsi Ykan font.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
